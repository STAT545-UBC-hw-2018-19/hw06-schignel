## Goals

Complete two of six possible tasks on data wrangling!


## Task 1: Character data

The following exercises explore a number of tools for wrangling strings.

First, we load `stringr` package for working with character strings
```{r}
library(stringr)
library(stringi)
```


### Exercise 14.2.5

**[1]** In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see paste() and paste0(). What’s the difference between the two functions? What stringr function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA?

*Answer:*

- `paste()` converts vectors to characters and concatenates them based on a rule (in this case, a specific separator). 
- `paste0()` accomplishes the same task, but assumes that sep = "", so it can be quicker option if the data is in the correct format. 

We see this in the following examples:
```{r}
# use sep for individual character strings
paste("a", "b", sep = "")

# use collapse for one string
x <- c("a", "b")
paste(x, collapse = "")

# use paste0() to assume "" as separator
paste0("a", "b")

# here we see that this is equivalent to `str_c` from stringr
str_c("a", "b")
```

- With `str_c`, when a missing value is combined with another string, the result will be missing (NA). You can then use str_replace_na() to convert NA to "NA"

- `paste()`, on the otherhand, coerces the missing value (NA) to "NA" automatically. 



**[2]** In your own words, describe the difference between the sep and collapse arguments to str_c().

*Answer:*

- "sep"" is used to control how individual character strings are to be separated
- "collapse" is used to change a vector of strings into a single string.


**[3]** Use str_length() and str_sub() to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

*Answer:*
```{r}
odd <- "Steve"
str_length(odd)

# Middle character of 5 is 3
str_sub(odd, 3,3)

even <- "Steve!"
str_length(even)

# Middle two characters of 6 is 3 and 4
str_sub(odd, 3,4)

```


**[4]** What does str_wrap() do? When might you want to use it?

*Answer:*

`str_wrap()` is a wrapper around stringi::stri_wrap() which implements the Knuth-Plass paragraph wrapping algorithm. It reformats a character vector of strings based on a specificie dwidth and indentation and/or exdentation. 

This would be useful for customizing the display of large blocks of texts, to ensure they are printed as nice, legible paragraphs. 


**[5]** What does str_trim() do? What’s the opposite of str_trim()?

*Answer:*

- `str_trim()` removes whitespace from start and end of string. The "side" argument specifics the side on which to remove whitespace (left, right, or both).

- `str_pad()` does the opposite, adding whitespace based on specified width and side.



**[6]** Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2.

*Answer:*
```{r}
a <- c("a", "b", "c")
a

vec2str <- function(x){
  if (length(x) <=1)  {
    x 
  }else{ 
    str_c(x, collapse = ", ")
  }
}
vec2str(c("a", "b", "c"))
```


### Exercise 14.3.1.1 

**[1]** Explain why each of these strings don’t match a `\`: 

*Answer:*

- `"\"` This has a special behavior assigned to it already (i.e. escape)

- `"\\"` This escapes the escape behavior to create regular expression

- `"\\\"` This is a regular expression that requires a string, which must also be escaped in order to match a literal `\`.


**[2]** How would you match the sequence `"'\?`

*Answer:*
```{r}
z <- "\"\'\\?"
z
str_view("?", "\\?")
```

**[3]** What patterns will the regular expression \..\..\.. match? How would you represent it as a string?

*Answer:*

It will match the pattern: ".wildcard.wildcard.wildcard"
```{r}

string <- "\\..\\..\\.."
string
str_view(".h.h.hurry!", "\\..\\..\\..")
```



### Exercise 14.3.2.1

**[1]** How would you match the literal string "$^$"?

*Answer:*
```{r}
#example
str_view("F$^$@!", pattern = "\\$\\^\\$", match = TRUE)

```


**[2]** Given the corpus of common words in stringr::words, create regular expressions that find all words that:

*Answer:*

Start with “y”.
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "^y", match = TRUE)
```

End with “x”
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "$x", match = TRUE)
```

Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using `str_length()`!)
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "^...$", match = TRUE)
```

Have seven letters or more.
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "^.......", match = TRUE)
```


### Exercise 14.3.3.1

**[1]** Create regular expressions to find all words that:

*Answer:*
```{r}
# Start with a vowel.
str_view(words, pattern = "^[aeiou]", match = TRUE)

# That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
str_view(words, pattern = "^[^aeiou]*$", match = TRUE)

# End with ed, but not with eed.
str_view(words, pattern = "[^e]ed$", match = TRUE)

# End with ing or ise.
str_view(words, pattern = "(ing|ise)$", match = TRUE)
```


**[2]** Empirically verify the rule “i before e except after c”.

*Answer:*
```{r}
# NOT SURE
str_view(words, pattern = "cie", match = TRUE)

str_view(words, pattern = "(c).*(i).*(e)*", match = TRUE)
```


**[3]** Is “q” always followed by a “u”?

*Answer:*
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "q[^u]", match = TRUE)
```
Yes, "u" always follows "q" in the *words* dataset.


**[4]** Write a regular expression that matches a word if it’s probably written in British English, not American English. Note: rules based on the [Oxford dictionaries British and American English spelling](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/british-and-spelling)

*Answer:*
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "[^aeiou]re$|[^aeiou]our$|[^aeiou]ise$|[^aeiou]yse$|[aeiou]ll[aeiou]$|[aeiou]ence$|[aeiou]ogue$|ae|oe", match = TRUE)
```



**[5]** Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country.

*Answer:*
In the United States, phone numbers are written in the following way: 1-(XXX)-XXX-XXXX

```{r}
# example
str_view("1-(555)-541-2679", pattern = "1-\\([0-9][0-9][0-9]\\)-[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]", match = TRUE)
```


### Exercise 14.3.4.1

**[1]** Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.

*Answer:*
Let's use the roman numerals provided by the R for Data Science Strings chapter:
```{r}
w <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"

# ?: 0 or 1
str_view(w, "C{1,2}?")

# +: 1 or more
str_view(w, "C{1,}")

# *: 0 or more
str_view(w, "C{0,}")
```


**[2]** Describe in words what these regular expressions match: (read carefully to see if I’m using a regular expression or a string that defines a regular expression.)

1. ^.*$

*Answer:*
Matches any string (i.e, starts with anything, repeated indefinitely before the end)

2. "\\{.+\\}"

*Answer:*
Matches any character (repeated 1 or more times) surrounded by squiggle brackets

3. \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}

*Answer:*
Matches any digit repeated four times, dash, any digit repeated two times, dash, any digit repeated two times.

4. "\\\\{4}"

*Answer:*
Matches a string of two backslashes.


**[3]** Create regular expressions to find all words that:

- Start with three consonants.
```{r}
str_view_all(words, pattern = "^[^aeiou][^aeiou][^aeiou]", match = TRUE)
```

- Have three or more vowels in a row.
```{r}
str_view_all(words, pattern = "[aeiou][aeiou][aeiou]", match = TRUE)
```

- Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.
```{r}
str_view_all(words, pattern = "([aeiou][^aeiou]){2,}", match = TRUE)
```


**[4]** Solve the beginner regexp crosswords at https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner.



### Exercise 14.3.5.1

**[1]** Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

1. (.)\1\1 

*Answer:* Any character that repeates three times in a row

2. "(.)(.)\\2\\1" 

*Answer:* Any two characters that appear consecutively but switch positions (e.g., abba)

3. (..)\1

*Answer* Any two characters that appear consecutively in the same position.

4. "(.).\\1.\\1"

*Answer* Any character, followed by any character, followed, by the first character, followed by any character, followed by the first character (e.g., "abada")


5. "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"

*Answer* Any four or more characters, followed by the third, second, and first characters (e.g., "abcdefcba")


**[2]** Construct regular expressions to match words that:

1. Start and end with the same character.
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "^(.).*\\1$", match = TRUE)

```

2. Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. “church” contains “ch” repeated twice.)
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "(.)(.).*\\1\\2.*", match = TRUE)
```

3. Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. “eleven” contains three “e”s.)
```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "(.).*\\1.*\\1.*", match = TRUE)
```

### Exercise 14.4.2 

**[1]** For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.

1. Find all words that start or end with x.

```{r}
# regex
str_view_all(words, "^x|x$", match = TRUE)
# multiple str_detect
str_detect(words, "^x")
str_detect(words, "x$")
```

2. Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
```{r}
str_detect(words, "^[aeiou][^aeiou]$")
```

3. Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?
```{r}
sum(str_detect(words, "a")) +
sum(str_detect(words, "e")) +
sum(str_detect(words, "i")) +
sum(str_detect(words, "o")) +
sum(str_detect(words, "u"))

```


**[2]** What word has the highest number of vowels? What word has the highest proportion of vowels? (Hint: what is the denominator?)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
df <- tibble(
  word = words, 
  i = seq_along(word)
)

# find the count and proportion of vowels for each word
df.vowels <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    proportion = str_count(word, "[aeiou]")/str_length(word) 
        ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(vowels)) %>% 
  mutate()
```
There are eight words tied for the most vowels (5). 

Let's arange by proportion to find the word has the highest proportion of vowels:
```{r}
arrange(df.vowels, desc(proportion))

```
We can see that the answer is the letter "a", which makes sense, considering it is comprised of one letter, and that letter is a vowel.


### Exercise 14.4.3.1 

**[1]** In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.

*Answer:*
```{r}
# add a space before "red"
colours <- c(" red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match

#check problem is fixed (i.e. "flickered is not matched")
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, colour_match)
```

**[2]** From the Harvard sentences data, extract:

1. The first word from each sentence.
```{r}
# get a reminder of the sentences
head(sentences)

# use the word() function!
head(word(sentences, 1))
```

2.All words ending in ing.
```{r}
#Couldn't quite get this one...
#str_view_all(words, ".*ing$", match = TRUE)
#has.ing.words <- str_subset(sentences, ".*ing$")
#ing.words <- str_extract(has.ing.words,".*ing$" )
#str_extract(ing.words, ".*ing$", simplify = TRUE)
```


3. All plurals.
```{r}
# This one also stymied me!
```


### Exercise 14.4.4.1

**[1]** Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word.

```{r}

```


**[2]** Find all contractions. Separate out the pieces before and after the apostrophe.

*Answer:*
```{r}

```


### Exercise 14.4.5.1

**[1]** Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes.

*Answer:*
```{r}
str_replace_all("Files/Documents/Homework", "/", "\\\\")
```

**[2]** Implement a simple version of str_to_lower() using replace_all().

*Answer:*
```{r}
str_replace_all("Uppercase Stinks!", c("U" = "u", "S" = "s"))
```

**[3]** Switch the first and last letters in words. Which of those strings are still words?

*Answer:*
```{r}
#Couldn't quite get this one...
#str_replace_all(words, "([[^ ]]+) ([[ $]]+)", "\\2 \\1")
```


### Exercise 14.4.6.1

**[1]** Split up a string like "apples, pears, and bananas" into individual components.

*Answer:*
```{r}
str_split("apples, pears, and bananas", " ")
```

**[2]** Why is it better to split up by boundary("word") than " "?

*Answer:*
Because boundary("word") will give you each of the words and drop the commas:
```{r}
str_split("apples, pears, and bananas", boundary("word"))
```

**[3]** What does splitting with an empty string ("") do? Experiment, and then read the documentation.

*Answer:*
```{r}
# experiment
str_split("apples, pears, and bananas", "")
```
We see that it has split by character. In other words, it's equivalent to using boundary("character").

### Exercise 14.5.1

**[1]** How would you find all strings containing \ with regex() vs. with fixed()?

*Answer:*
```{r}
#with regex
str_view_all("\\_\\", regex("\\\\"))

#with fixed
#str_detect("\\_\\", fixed("\"))
```

**[2]** What are the five most common words in sentences?

*Answer:*
```{r}
# Couldn't figure this one out...
```



### Exercise 14.7.1

**[1]** Find the stringi functions that:

Count the number of words.

*Answer:* stri_count_words()

Find duplicated strings.

*Answer:* stri_duplicated() or stri_duplicated_any()

Generate random text. 

*Answer:* stri_rand_lipsum()


**[2]** How do you control the language that stri_sort() uses for sorting?

*Answer:* sorts the vector according to a lexicographic order, and allows you to specify a custom ICU (International Components for Unicode) collator.


## Task 2: Work with a list

The following exercise explores lists using twitter data from Donald Trump. We will be working through Jenny Bryan's [purrr tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls08_trump-tweets.html).

Load the required libraries and download some tweets from the official Donald Trump account.
```{r}
library(purrr)
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(tibble)

#load(url("http://varianceexplained.org/files/trump_tweets_df.rda"))
load("trump_tweets_df.rda")
glimpse(trump_tweets_df)

tweets <- trump_tweets_df$text
tweets %>% head() %>% strtrim(70)
```

### Trump Android words

Here are some words that were shown to be associated with Trump tweets from an Android device. Smush them together into a regular expression – we’ll use it soon!

```{r}
regex <- "badly|crazy|weak|spent|strong|dumb|joke|guns|funny|dead"
```

Our mission: extract these Trump Android words from the tweets we’ve stored. While getting lots of purrr practice.

A small mercy from the future: we will learn just as much (or more) if we scale down this problem. Allow me to preselect rows that have all the complexity we need.

```{r}
tweets <- tweets[c(1, 2, 5, 6, 198, 347, 919)]
tweets %>% strtrim(70)
```

FYI I preselected tweets with 0, 1, 2, and 3 occurrences of Trump Android words.

### Are you ready for gregexpr()?

No, you are not.

Use the base function gregexpr() to locate all the Trump Android words inside the tweets. I chose gregexpr() for the glorious opportunity to deal with an Awkward List.

```{r}
matches <- gregexpr(regex, tweets)
str(matches)
```
What is `matches`?!?

- A list. One element per element of `tweets`.
- Each element is an integer vector.
    + It’s `-1` if no matches found.
    + Holds the position(s) of the first character of each match, otherwise.
- Each element has two attributes. Consider `match.length`. Let us not speak of the other one.
    + It’s -1 if no matches found.
    + Holds the length(s) of each match, otherwise.

We can clearly extract the matched words with this information. But it’s going to hurt.

### Preview of `substring()` target function

Our eventual target function is `substring()`. Read the help on it now! Here are the highlights:


USAGE:
substring(text, first, last)

ARGUMENTS:
text = character
first = integer, position where substring to extract starts
last = integer, position where substring to extract stops


Imagine each tweet playing the role of `text`.
The elements of `matches` are awfully close to what we need for `first`.
But we don’t have anything to use for `last` yet.
This is going to be Job #1.
Job #2 is to insert `substring()` and `tweets` + `matches` + result of Job #1 into the `purrr::map()` machinery.

Here’s where we are heading:

![](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/purrr-slides-trump-tweets.png)
### Get to know your Awkward List

How long are the elements of `matches`?
```{r}
lengths(matches)                      # just happens to exist for length
sapply(matches, length)               # NSFP = not safe for programming
vapply(matches, length, integer(1))   # preferred base approach
map_int(matches, length)              # purrr way
```

Exercise: Get a list of the match lengths.

Each element of matches carries this information in an attribute named match.length(). Store this info in a list called match_length.

- Pick one nontrivial example, e.g. m <- matches[[7]].
- Get the attribute named match.length. Hint: attr().
- Drop that approach into purrr::map() to scale up to the full matches list.

Here’s how to do that for the last element of matches:

```{r}
m <- matches[[7]]
attr(m, which = "match.length")
```

Different ways to apply this logic to the entire matches list.

1 Pre-defined custom function. Conceptually simplest? Most verbose.
```{r}
ml <- function(x) attr(x, which = "match.length")
map(matches, ml)
```

2 Anonymous function. More abstract? Very compact.
```{r}
map(matches, ~ attr(.x, which = "match.length"))
```
3 Pre-existing function, additional arguments passed via `...`.
```{r}
(match_length <- map(matches, attr, which = "match.length"))
```
It’s good to know about all 3 approaches.
Exercise: Count the number of Trump Android words in each tweet.

Let’s compute how many Trump Android words appear in each tweet.

This isn’t quite lengths(matches), though, is it? Think about those -1s. Sad.

- Pick two examples at the extremes: a tweet with 0 Trump words and another with 3.
- Write some code that takes the associated element of matches and returns 0 or 3, as appropriate.
- Use one of the approaches above to insert this into purrr::map() and apply to matches.

Code that works for both extreme examples:
```{r}
m <- matches[[1]]
sum(m > 0)

m <- matches[[7]]
sum(m > 0)

```
Insert into the machinery:
```{r}
f <- function(x) sum(x > 0)
map(matches, f)
map(matches, ~ sum(.x > 0))
```
Note that only 2 of the 3 approaches are workable here. That’s why it’s nice to know all of them.

What is the resulting object?
What would be a simpler form of the same info?
Read the help on map_int() and its other type-specific friends.
Tweak your existing approach to return an integer vector, with length equal to the number of tweets.

```{r}
map_int(matches, ~ sum(.x > 0))
```
Confirm that this is, indeed, different from just taking the lengths of the elements of matches:
```{r}
tibble(
  naive_length = lengths(matches),
  n_words = map_int(matches, ~ sum(.x > 0))
)
```
### Strip the attributes from matches

Exercise!

We have safely stored the match lengths in match_length.

Let’s create an almost-copy of matches and call it match_first. How will it differ? Remove the attributes from the elements of matches, so there’s less clutter when we print.

Hint: as.vector() will strip attributes.
```{r}
(match_first <- map(matches, as.vector))
```

### Assess progress in a small example

Use the R objects on hand to achieve our goal in a small example: extract Trump words from single tweet. Work on tweets #1 and #7 because they represent the two extremes, 0 and 3 words respectively. If you can handle them, you’re in good shape.

Relevant R objects:
```{r}
tweets %>% strtrim(70)
match_first
match_length
```
Start with tweet #7, with 3 Trump words.
```{r}
(tweet <- tweets[7])

(t_first <- match_first[[7]])

(t_length <- match_length[[7]])

(t_last <- t_first + t_length - 1)

substring(tweet, t_first, t_last)

```
How well does this code work for tweet #1, with 0 Trump words?

```{r}
(tweet <- tweets[1])
(t_first <- match_first[[1]])
(t_length <- match_length[[1]])
(t_last <- t_first + t_length - 1)
substring(tweet, t_first, t_last)
```

There is some nonsense along the way and we get an empty string. I’d rather get character(0) or NA_character_ back, but I can live with this.

But we’re in good shape. We just need to compute where the matches end for all matches.
Store where Trump words end

Make a list that holds where the Trump words end. Call it match_last.

Pseudo-code for how we did this for a single tweet:

first  <- an element of matches
length <- an element of match_length
last   <- first + length - 1

This is another map()-type problem, but instead of mapping over one list, we need to map over 2 lists in parallel.

Read the help for purrr::map2()!

Here’s the usage:
map2(.x, .y, .f, ...)

Match this up to our task:

- Input 1 = .x will be first
- Input 2 = .y will be length
- Function .f will be something that does first + length - 1. Either a custom pre-defined function or an anonymous function. Your call.

Do it!
```{r}
(match_last <- map2(match_first, match_length, ~ .x + .y - 1))
```
### Extract the Trump words

We’re ready to put everything together.

Pseudo-code for how we do this for a single tweet:

text   <- an element of tweets
first  <- an element of match_first
last   <- an element of match_last
substring(text, first, last)

This is another map()-type problem, but instead of mapping over one list, we need to map over 3 lists in parallel.

There is no map3(). This calls for pmap(). Read the help on it!

Here’s the usage:

pmap(.l, .f, ...)

How does this relate to our task?

- .l is a list of lists = the 3 lists we need to work through in parallel
    + list(text = tweets, first = match_first, last = match_last)
    + I deliberately choose the list names to match the argument names of substring(). Why confuse yourself? Why rely on position when you don’t have to?
- Function .f will be substring().

Do it!
```{r}
pmap(list(text = tweets, first = match_first, last = match_last), substring)
```
We did it!

#### March through the rows in a data frame

Remember that a data frame is, in fact, a list of equal-length vectors. Just like the .l argument of pmap(). So often it’s nice to work your problems in the context of a data frame, instead of using free-floating vectors or lists. Why?

- It’s safer. This makes it very hard for you to subset or reorder one of the pieces and forget to do the same to the others.
- It’s tidier. Your project is contained in one neat object. You can print it, View() it, str(), etc. to get a sense of how things stand. This is more annoying if stuff is lying around in separate objects, so you’re less likely to catch problems quickly.

How would we do that post hoc here?
```{r}
mdf <- tibble(
  text = tweets,
  first = match_first,
  last = match_last
)
pmap(mdf, substring)
```
Yes, it all boils down to this.
